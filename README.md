I Made The Following Contributions to the project: 

Grouped the data by year and created a new column 'Year' in the dataframe to store the year information.

Grouped the data by year and type, and created a table showing the total duration in seconds for each combination of year and type. This table was then unstacked to make it more readable. The columns were also renamed to 'MOVIES' and 'TV SHOWS' for better understanding.

Grouped the data by the year and genre, and created a line chart showing the number of views for the top 5 genres by year. The data was also unstacked to make it more readable and the top 5 genres were chosen to focus on.

Calculated the average duration of episodes for each genre in minutes, and created a heatmap to visualize the data. This heatmap shows the average duration of episodes for each genre in minutes, making it easy to compare the different genres.
