# CO2 **Emissions**

**Carbon dioxide emissions** are the primary driver of global climate change. Itâ€™s widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.

##Causes of CO2 Emissions

---

- **Burning fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy**


- **Transportation (primarily from cars, trucks, and airplanes)**


- **Deforestation and other land-use changes**


##Effects of CO2 Emissions

--- 

- **Global warming and climate change**


- **Rising sea levels**


- **Negative impacts on human health and well-being**


- **More frequent and severe extreme weather events (heat waves, droughts, floods)**


- **Ocean acidification**


# How can data Science helps with CO2 Emissions?

---
Data science can help with CO2 emissions by analyzing and identifying patterns in energy consumption and emissions data. This can aid in the development of more efficient energy systems, the implementation of carbon pricing, and the identification of the most significant sources of emissions.


#Dataset Overview

---
**This dataset provides an in-depth look into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level allowing for a better understanding of how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate. It contains information on total emissions as well as from coal, oil, gas, cement production and flaring, and other sources. The data also provides a breakdown of per capita CO2 emission per country.**

##Here some of the results that we have extracted after analyzing the dataset:

**This chart shows the amount of CO2 emissions from coal for the 5 countries: China, USA, Russia, Japan, and Germany**

**Shown here is China the highest CO2 emissions country then USA**

**The amount of CO2 emissions from other sources for the 3 countries: Canada, Russia, and Australia**

**It is shown here that CO2 emissions from other sources in Russia in the 1990s were high and then decreased and mediated.**
**As for the amount of CO2 emissions in Canada and Australia in all years were below average**

**This chart shows The amount of CO2 emissions from the Top 10 countries by Per Capita based on the years:**

**1990: Estonia**


**1991: Luxembourg**


**1992: Luxembourg**


**1993: Luxembourg**


**1994: Luxembourg**


**2004: Luxembourg**


**2005: Luxembourg**


**2006: Luxembourg**


**2007: Luxembourg**

**This chart shows The amount of CO2 emissions from the top 5 countries with the highest rate by Oil:**

1. USA
2. China
3. Russia
4. Japan
5. Germany

**this figure shows the amount of CO2 emissions for capita in the two largest countries in the world. we conclude that between 2000 and 2020 the amount of CO2 emissions has decreased in USA and vice versa in china that increase through the years.**

**the following figure show comparisons the cause of co2 emissions from 1970 to 2021.we concluded that oil and gas were the mainly cause of the problem.**

**The following figure shows the amount of CO2 emissions for each individual in all country 
We can conclude that the amount of CO2 has increased per capita.**
