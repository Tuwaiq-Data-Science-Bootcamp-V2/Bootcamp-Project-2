# Data Preprocessing and Analysis ðŸ“Š

## Based on what youâ€™ve learned until now, use NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib to create a project of your choosing. This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements:

- Choose a public dataset that needs to clean and preprocess.
- EDA
    - Apply the essential EDA steps: head, shape, info, describe, missing values
    - Apply the additional EDA steps based on your dataset needs.
- Data Visualization
    - Drive meaningful insights (at least 8 different charts, 5 of them are unique).
    - Draw a subplot using the previous charts.
    - Apply chart format include:
      - Choose a specific style for your charts.
      - Use title, x and y labels, font size, figure size, legends.
- Use pandas profiling.
- Report your final conclusion and findings in one page (readme markdown file).
    - Team members and the role of each one.
    - Introduction (problem, objectives)
    - Dataset Overview and Source.
    - Describe the final eight insights.
    
- The Final presentation will be on Sunday (10 min for each group).
- Due Date: Sat, 21 Jan, 12:00 am.

### Final Deliverables:
- Notebook file(.ipynb).
- Dataset file.
- README.md file.
